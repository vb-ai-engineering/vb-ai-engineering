I'm a developer that loves simplifying things. I love breaking down complex problems into easy solutions. I Currently live in Paris as a software developer. My goal with coding is to help others. I enjoy being able to create something that other people can use to make their lives easier. I take criticism well, and use suggestions to improve the product.
